OpenWRT images are based on UBI.
Image contains luci.
Image don't have VDSL.bin firmware, need to be uploaded to /lib/firmware after flash

Included dts file for P-2812HNU-F3.

Currently NOR contains only U-Boot and ENV, OpenWRT starts from NAND address 0x60000 like in F1 board, will be corrected soon, as it helps me to build/correct dts for F1 when it arrives.
Thx to @oxo
